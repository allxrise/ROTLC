# About this mod

* This mod has a one job, and it's doing its own job perfectly.
* And it's job is removes cheat on/off switch from Open To LAN screen.
* If anyone finds to way to open cheats, they can't open it. I hard coded to turn off cheats. It might be going to have
  problems with other mods but I can't look every mods source and see if it's incompatible.
* If you see any incompliment with other mods, you can freely open an issue to report.
