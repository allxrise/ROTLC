# About this mod

* This mod has one job, and it's doing its own job perfectly,
and it's job is removes cheat on/off switch from Open To LAN screen.
* If anyone finds a way to open cheats, they can't open it. I hard coded to turn off cheats. It might have problems with other mods, but I can't look at every mod source and see if it's incompatible.
* If you see any incompatibility with other mods, you can freely open an issue to report it.

# Permissions

* Everyone can use this mod in their mod-packs, but if the pack is going to be published anywhere, the publisher should let me know.

# Credits

* [Kn0ax](https://github.com/Kn0ax) for giving this awesome idea. ^_^
